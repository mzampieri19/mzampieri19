# Michelangelo Zampieri

I am a rising junior at Brandeis University studying Computer Science and Applied Mathematics. 
I am interested in machine learning an application in AI, as well as data science and big data analysis. 
I have a small introduction to that field in the form of a foundations course through BTTAI and will begin to work on a project with a company advisor to expand on my machine learning knowledge.
I am always looking for opportunities, especially for internships and experiences, and always open for communication. I can provide a copy of my resume per request.
