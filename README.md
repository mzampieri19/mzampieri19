# Michelangelo Zampieri

I am a senior at Brandeis University studying Computer Science and Applied Mathematics. 
I am interested in machine learning an application in AI, as well as data science. 
I have now gained a solid understanding of machine learning and some uses, my experience comes from:

- Break Through Tech AI, where I leanred foundational knowledge, and applied it in creating a model to predict industry, job, function and sector for nation-wide job searching platform with 70,000+ companies world wide.
- TAMID, I worked along side many of my peers to conduct research into and build a CNN model to identify different plastics uaing data augmentation and transfer learning. Additionatly built many other models inclusing, Random Forest and LSTM for weather prediction. 
- Many personal projects, including a classification exploration to dive deeper into unsupervised learning using reduction techniques (PCA and tSNE) and clustering algorithms (KMeans and DBSCAN). 
    
I am always looking for opportunities, especially for internship experiences, and always open for communication. I can provide a copy of my resume per request.

On my profile I have the following repositories: 

1. Machine Learning Explorations
- `Image Classfier`- A CNN I created and fin tuned for a dataset of satelite images I found on Kaggle.
- `Clustering`- Exploration of clustering techniques, and projections (PCA, tSNE, KMeans, and DBSCAN).

2. Machine Learning Group Projects
- `MIT-AJL-Team1`(Group Project)- Part of the BTTAI x AJL Spring 2025 Kaggle competition where my team and I built a series of CNN to predict different skin conditions on varying skin tones.
- `TAMID group` (Group project)- My group and I a series of CNNs to predict types of plastics from images of plastic codes. Part of the TAMID internship for Spring 2025.
- `Real-Salary` (Group project)- BTTAI Fall 2024 Project. My group and I built a model that predicts sector, industry and job function for various companies.

3. Other Person Projects
- `Michael-projects`- A collection mof small scale personal projects I created that I did not make their own repos for.
- `Food-cost-web`- A small scale web app for a food cost calculator I created after seeing the manager at the restaurant I work at manually calculating the cost.
- `Food-cost-app`- A mobile app version of `food-cost-web`. Not working.
- `Dialysis-Tracker-App`- An idea for an app I had that helps dialysis patients like myself track differetn aspects of their health (such as water intake, nutrition, and lab results).

4. Class Repos
- `Break-Through-Tech-AI-2024`- All the labs and assignmnets I completed for BTTAI 2024. 
- `CS153`- Code for my term project for CS153, Web App Development, at Brandeis University. Where I build a web app that serves as a store front for a potential flower shop, inspired by my girlfriend and her dream of opening a flower shop. 
- `flower-shop-DB`- Code for a version of the flower shop app (See CS153) that uses adatabase and database managment. 
- `flower-server`- Code for a version of the flower shop app (See CS153) that uses server communication. 
- `CS131`- Code for my programming projects for CS131, Operating Systems, at Brandeis University. This repo is left private as accordance to class policy. 
- `CS150`- Code for my programming projects for CS150, Compiler Design, at Brandeis University. This repo is left private as accordance to class policy.
