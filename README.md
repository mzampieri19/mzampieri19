## 👋 About Me

I'm passionate about **Machine Learning**, **AI Applications**, and **Data Science**. I’ve developed a solid foundation in ML through academic coursework, internships, and self-driven projects. My hands-on experience spans model building, end-to-end pipelines, and full-stack applications powered by AI.

### Key Experiences:
- **Break Through Tech AI (Fall 2024):** Collaborated on a classification model to predict industry, job function, and sector for over 70,000 companies on a national job search platform.
- **TAMID Machine Learning Internship (Spring 2025):** Built CNN models to identify plastic types using transfer learning; developed Random Forest and LSTM models for weather prediction.
- **Personal Projects:** Applied clustering and dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA and t-SNE; built and trained a GPT language model from scratch using PyTorch.

I’m currently seeking opportunities in ML engineering, research, or data science. Feel free to reach out!

## 📌 Featured Projects

### 🚀 Custom GPT Language Model (PyTorch)  
A character-level GPT language model built **entirely from scratch using PyTorch**, inspired by the [freeCodeCamp tutorial](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/). The model was trained and scaled through 4 versions, evolving from a proof-of-concept to a capable LLM trained on a Common Crawl dataset.

**Highlights:**
- Implemented all architecture components manually: tokenizer, batching, multi-head self-attention, residual connections, and training loop.
- Trained multiple versions:
  - **model-01:** Minimal dataset, proof-of-concept.
  - **model-02:** 50,000-epoch training on small data, improved coherence.
  - **model-03:** 300,000 lines of Project Gutenberg text, strong grammar and structure.
  - **model-04:** Trained on 1M-line Common Crawl subset (4GB), best-performing version to date.
- Optimized for Apple Silicon (MPS) and Google Colab.
- Includes terminal chatbot using trained weights.

**Tools:** PyTorch, Python, MPS, Google Colab
