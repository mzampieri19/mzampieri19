# Michelangelo Zampieri

I am a senior at Brandeis University studying Computer Science and Applied Mathematics. 
I am interested in machine learning an application in AI, as well as data science. 
I have now gained a solid understanding of machine learning and some uses, my experience comes from:

- Break Through Tech AI, where I leanred foundational knowledge, and applied it in creating a model to predict industry, job, function and sector for nation-wide job searching platform with 70,000+ companies world wide.
- TAMID, I worked along side many of my peers to conduct research into and build a CNN model to identify different plastics uaing data augmentation and transfer learning. Additionatly built many other models inclusing, Random Forest and LSTM for weather prediction. 
- Many personal projects, including a classification exploration to dive deeper into unsupervised learning using reduction techniques (PCA and tSNE) and clustering algorithms (KMeans and DBSCAN). 
    
I am always looking for opportunities, especially for internship experiences, and always open for communication. I can provide a copy of my resume per request.
